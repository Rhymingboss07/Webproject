            <h1>About <span>Us</span></h1>
            <p>The demand of a globalized era is so high that it requires a competitive labor force or the development of highly skilled and well-educated human resources. To attain these, all learning institution must exert effort to harness the potentials of their students to have globally competitive graduates. Until, a higher educational institution (HEI) was established after a survey was conducted by way of random sampling of parents from La Union and from the northern and western towns of Pangasinan whose children are in elementary and secondary schools could be a prospective students of the proposed HEI.</p>
            <br>
            <p>All CHED requirements were prepared by the group including the province’s prospective courses to be offered which are the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Bachelor of Science in Accountancy (BSA), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSE), Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEE), and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT). While the institution was waiting for the approval of Commission on Higher Education (CHED), the Board of Trustees composed of 9 members of the 15 incorporators likewise discussed the offering of short term courses offered by Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). After the visit of the TESDA technical panel, the institution was permitted to offer four short term courses namely Computer Hardware Servicing NC II, Computer Programming NC IV, PC Operation NC II, and Tourism Housekeeping NC II which started on the 1st semester of the school year 2007-2008.</p>
            <br>
            <p>PCNL is expected to be socially desirable and economically viable for the reason that the academic courses shall increase the number of professionals and technical people in the region and will contribute to human resources pooling for local and foreign employment. Likewise it will help pave the way to the development of more industries that will generate more employment opportunities and consequently enhance and improve the economy and the people’s quality of life.</p>
